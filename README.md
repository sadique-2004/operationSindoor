# 🇮🇳 Operation Sindoor 🇮🇳

**Operation Sindoor** is a fun, interactive React-based project that gives off a strong warning with a patriotic vibe when triggered. Built with ❤️ for the Indian Army, it displays randomly chosen strong slogans in a developer-themed code format, along with the Army slogan and visual pride.
